\begin_layout Title
Mean-Shift Tracking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Jae Lee
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Object tracking using mean shift algorithm is presented in this paper.
 The implementation presented here uses only color histogram of the object
 to be tracked.
 Then, mean shift algorithm is applied to conduct similarity search using
 the backprojection image of the object's color histogram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object tracking is an interesting topic that has been attracting many researcher
s in the field of computer vision.
 It has a variety of applications such as human-computer interaction, surveillan
ce, augmented reality, and traffic control etc.
 The goal of object tracking is to detect the object of interest and find
 its location continuously and robustly in a sequence of images that is
 either recorded or displayed in real-time.
 As one of the applications of object tracking, researchers in MAGICC lab
 directed by Dr.
 Randy Beard has been developing an algorithm called Recursive RANSAC to
 track multiple-objects simultaneously which is mainly intended to be used
 on unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of R-RANSAC algorithm is first to identify any moving objects
 in a video sequence and store the trajectories of these objects.
 Second, it keeps managing a list of tracks using R-RANSAC algorithm.
 For example, if a track has existed for sometime above threshold and has
 a high enough inlier ratio which means previous measurements support the
 current measurement as a part of the track, the track is classified as
 a good track.
 Otherwise, it is classified as a bad track in a list that won't be displayed
 in the tracking result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, one thing that can be tried to make the R-RANSAC tracking more
 robust is to add a feature based tracker because R-RANSAC currently only
 cares about trajectories of the objects.
 In this paper, a tracking using mean shift algorithm on color histogram
 is examined as one possible option to enhance the robustness of R-RANSAC
 tracking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the name of the algorithm implies, mean shift is an algorithm that shifts
 a window (for example, a circle) so that the window includes the most possible
 points of interest.
 As the window continues to shift to include more points, eventually it
 is expected to arrive to a point that includes the maximum number of points.
 Because of this behavior, it is a hill climbing algorithm.
 Figure 1 below describes this process.

Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mean shift is just a fundamental algorithm that can be applied to solve
 any other problems, not just tracking problem.
 Itself doesnâ€™t imply any tracking capability.
 Thus, it seems appropriate to explain what other things need to happen
 before actually using the mean shift.
 The basic idea of mean shift tracking is to find a window that has the
 most similar color histogram in the current image to the color histogram
 of the object to be tracked as shown in Figure 2.

The color histogram of the object to be tracked is searched for in input
 image.
 The metric to measure the similarity of two histograms is Bhattachayya
 Coefficient.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is computationally rather inefficient if the histogram is calculated
 for all possible windows in every frame of a video stream.
 For this reason, it is common to use histogram backprojection to reduce
 the computation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 When an image is backprojected with a model histogram, the resulting image
 will show the probability distribution of how similar to a model histogram.
 Then, mean shift is applied on the backprojected image to find where the
 track is likely to be.
 Figure 3 summarizes the process of mean shift tracking.

\begin_layout Section
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This version of mean shift tracking implementation takes advantage of Open
 Source Computer Vision library(OpenCV) since OpenCV provided with several
 proper functions for the implementation such as calcHist(), normalize(),
 calcBackproject(), and meanshift() as well as user interaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of mean shift tracking can be summarized as the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pick a point on the object of interest that describes the color information
 of the track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use connected component algorithm to find more part of the track.
 Then, create a mask that only contains the part of the track.
 The connected component looks for every connected pixels within certain
 color similaries to a point picked in step 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the mask created in step 2, calculate and store the color histogram
 of the track.
 Create the initial search window of the track.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Backproject the incoming image with the histogram stored in step 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Apply mean shift starting at the position of the search window in the previous
 frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Figure 4 - 8 show an example of each step.

Experimental work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean shift tracking was experimented on three different video stream:
 messi.mp4, byu.mp4 and seoul.mp4.
 Messi data illustrates an ideal setting that mean shift tracking might
 work quite robustly because camera doesn't move abrubtly and the size of
 the track doesn't change dramatically throughout the video.
 Also, the color of the track and background are noticably different.
 BYU data has a similar setting to Messi data in a way that camera is almost
 static, but it is also different in a way that some objects can have similar
 color to the background color.
 Seoul data was filmed in the most complex and crowded environment and the
 result of the mean shift tracking shows that it is not robust in dealing
 with occlusions and in crowded setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Result on Messi data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The performance on Messi data yielded the most satisfactory result of the
 mean shift tracking.
 Once the track is selected, it is being tracked to the end most of times.
 Figure 9-11 shows a successful scenario of the tracking.

 Figure 14-16 shows when the mean shift tracking can work well.
 Since an object with distinct color was selcted, there is only one distinct

 any problem following the track.

However, if an object with similar color to the background is to be tracked,
 the mean shift tracker is not robust and reliable because the backprojection
 would have multiple regions with high probability of matching to the histogram
 of the actual track.
 Subsequently, mean shift is confused in which direction the real track
 is moving.
 Figure 17-19 illustrates this scenario.

Result on Seoul data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mean shift tracker can not be considered as a robust tracker on an environment
 like in Seoul data.
 Many things can go wrong in many ways.
 However, this data is used to illustrate what happens on the track when
 being occluded by other objets.
 Figure 20-22 shows this situation.
 When the track(an orange color taxi) is occluded by the utility pole in
 the middle of the image, the mean shift tracker gets stuck at the right
 side of the pole even if the track is moving to the left side of the pole.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mean shift with the backprojection method can be used to track an object
 in a video stream.
 The ideal settings for mean shift tracking include the static or slowly
 moving camera and a distinct color of the object to be tracked.
 Other than in the ideal settings, mean shift tracking cannot be a robust
 tracking method.
 There are more ways that can go wrong than right in unidealized environment
 such as camera that moves too quick, objects intersecting across each other,
 selected track changing its size in video sequence, and the occlusion of
 the track.
 However, mean shift can be robust if used with other tracking schemes.
